Description: This package reinvigorates heatmaps as a visualization technique to allow for both Pearson's r and Spearman's rho to be visualized 
     in a single heatmap. It also can be used to calculate confidence intervals for Pearson's r coefficients via Fisher Z transformations. Using
     a binary grouping variable, confidence intervals that do not overlap can also be highlighted.
